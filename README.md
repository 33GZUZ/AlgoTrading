Collection of algorithmic trading helper files for TradingView

## How to use
First, read the README file that every Indicator and Strategy has in its folder, just to get an idea on how it works and what to expect from it. 
Then you can just copy the code of the *.pine* and paste it in the Pine Editor of your TradingView account. 

- Once you paste the code, you should then click **Save**
- Then click **Add to Chart**
- If you added a _strategy_ click on the gear icon that is on the right of the strategy name and change the **Order Size** from _1_ to _100_ and the _Contracts_ to _% of equity_ . Then check the **Strategy Tester** tab to check for the results
