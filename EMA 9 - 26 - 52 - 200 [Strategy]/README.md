## EMA 9 / 26 / 52 / 200

This strategy is based on my EMA 9 / 26 / 52 / 200 indicator.

- We use the _**200 EMA**_ for trend confirmation. If price is above, we go long, if it's below we only take short positions
- We use the _**52 EMA**_ as a potential Support Resistance, trailing Stop Loss / Take profit. If price closes above we only go long, if it close below we only take short positions
- We use the crosses of _**9 with 26 EMA**_ as entry - exit signal for long or short positions. A bullish cross of 9 EMA from below the 26 EMA is a long entry signal and a bearish cross of 9 EMA from above the 26 EMA is a short entry signal.
